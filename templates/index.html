   <h1 style="margin-left: 30px;">Aim of this portal</h1>
<p1 style="margin-left: 40px;">When we first talk of local governance the first word that comes to our minds is Panchayat. But the harsh reality is that the Panchayats have expanded theoretically more or less in a negative way in todays time. In the appeal to look mordern they have diregarded the grievances of the local public and have often become a political gimmick. When given the opportunity to use tech judiciously we aim at providing the grassroot level a vivid easy to use website that will become a one stop shop for all the social and local issues.</p1>

  <h1>Core Competency </h1>
<p1>•	Our project Sushasan Samvad proposes to solve the problem of local governance by enhancing the Panchayati Raj System digitally.
  <br>•	This web portal will allow recording of all the Panchayat meets and uploading of them online which will be visible to all irrespective of the time periods.
 <br> •	These recorded meets will be accessible to all the villagers as well as all the levels of administration for transparency, supervision and moderation.
  <br>•	Our site will have a meeting calander wherein the villagers can drop in their reviews and feedback for each meeting.
  <br>•	We will also provide a facility known as " "Shikayat Forum" wherein the villagers will not have to wait for weeks to express their grievances but will be able to list their concerns as agendas for the next meeting (since thes concerns wouldn't be voiced out specifically in meetings there are high chances that they are acknowledged and solved beforehand).
  <br>•	Important grievances and concerns that prevail will be listed as agendas. When one clicks on the upcoming meeting date he will be redirected to an agenda page that will be constituting all the grivances and concerns that are yet to be solved and require discussion and deliberation.

  <br>•	The website will also have a concrete community connect network which will attract NGO'S and community service providers to bring about an impact at the rural level through their services and participation in strengthening education, literacy and the economic growth. The NGO's will also integrate with the website in providing the villagers apt knowledge to use the website efficiently.</p1>
